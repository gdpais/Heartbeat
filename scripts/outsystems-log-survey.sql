-- Survey of an OutSystems 11 logging database for Heartbeat (TODO 3.3).
--
-- Read-only. Run it with a login that has SELECT on the oslog_* objects (the
-- extractor's login is enough) against the logging database, for example:
--   sqlcmd -S <server> -d <logging db> -U <login> -i scripts/outsystems-log-survey.sql -o survey.txt -y 0 -w 4000
-- Each section answers one open question of
-- docs/architecture/application-observability.md#open-questions, and
-- section 2 supplies the DDL of the fixtures under
-- services/db-collector/internal/collectors/outsystems/testdata/oslog/.
-- The output holds real rows (section 3): keep it out of git.
-- Sections 5 to 7 read the current and the previous week's views; on a busy
-- database run them off-peak. Each section is its own batch, so an error in
-- one does not stop the others.
