// Package export converts probe result samples into observable metrics.

// The [Recorder] interface is the basic write surface.  [ScopedRecorder]
// extends it with scoped replacement semantics: every series is owned by the
// [Scope] (collector, target, probe) that wrote it, and a new write for the
// same scope deletes the series that scope no longer reports.  This keeps
// label sets such as blocking session IDs, dropped databases, or removed
// targets from being exported forever with stale values.
//
// Two implementations are provided:
//
//   - [PrometheusExporter] registers one collector per unique metric name in
//     a Prometheus registry and exposes every series as a gauge or counter,
//     depending on the sample's [MetricType].  It is used in production and
//     is safe for concurrent use.
//
//   - [InMemoryExporter] stores recorded values in memory.  It is intended
//     for unit tests.
