// The recount (ADR 0008): once a minute, each log type counts again, per
// minute of Instant, the rows its query returns in the recount_window behind
// its watermark, and compares them with the rows it delivered there.
//
//   - More rows in the database than delivered: rows the log service
//     committed after the watermark had passed them, later than the lag.
//     They are never read; [MetricLateRows] counts them.
//   - Fewer: rows delivered more often than the database holds them, read
//     twice, which the extraction must never do, or deleted after they were
//     sent; [MetricDuplicateRows] counts them.  A batch sent again after
//     the Collector took it is delivered once here, so it is not counted.
//
// It only counts: nothing is read again or sent, so the recount cannot
// duplicate a row in Loki.  Each minute's difference is counted once, the
// first time a recount sees it, however many recounts cover that minute.
//
// A minute is (end − 1m, end], the bounds the query contract filters with,
// so the window (lo, hi], both whole minutes, holds whole minutes only.  The
// delivered counts live in memory and start again, after the watermark the
// call starts at, whenever they could no longer be compared: after a
// restart, once the watermark belongs to another database or moved back,
// and when a reload changes the recount_window or the query.  Only the
// minutes after that watermark are compared, which no earlier process or
// setting delivered into.  A log type with the recount off keeps no counts.
//
// The count wraps the log type's own query, query_template included, as a
// derived table, so it counts what extraction reads, with the same filters
// and joins; SQL Server reads only the Instant column of its index for it.
