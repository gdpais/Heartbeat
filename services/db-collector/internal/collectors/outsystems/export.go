// Waiting for the OTel Collector.
//
// The chart's Collector keeps the order of the batches across a restart only
// when its logs export queue holds a single request (values.yaml,
// otlp_http/logs): a larger queue sends the batches it was sending when it
// stopped after the rest, and Loki rejects their rows when it already has
// rows of the same stream more than an hour newer.  With a single request,
// the Collector accepts the next batch only once Loki has taken the previous
// one, so an export can take as long as Loki takes, or as long as Loki is
// down.  That is backpressure, not a failure of the logging database, so the
// export does not run under the probe deadline and does not fail the target:
//
//   - A batch is exported in the background, under the executor's own
//     context rather than the probe's, and the OTLP client retries it with a
//     bounded backoff until the Collector accepts it (otlp.Client).  The
//     watermark moves when it is accepted, as before.
//   - While a log type's export is pending, its extraction stops: no new
//     batch is read for it.  The rows were read, the result set closed and
//     the connection returned to the pool before the export started, so no
//     query, transaction or lock is held on SQL Server while it waits.
//   - A call waits for the batch it read until the probe deadline, so a
//     Collector that keeps up is never seen as blocked.  An export that is
//     still pending at the end of the call blocks the log type: the call
//     returns [collectors.ErrBlocked], the target stays up, and
//     heartbeat_outsystems_export_blocked is 1 until the export ends.  The
//     error names the last failed attempt, and an attempt that failed for
//     another reason than waiting (a wrong endpoint, a 5xx) is logged as a
//     warning, so a Collector that cannot be reached is not mistaken for a
//     busy one.
//   - Waiting is bounded so the target's other log types still run within
//     the cycle: in each cycle, which the call of the target's first log
//     type starts, its calls wait at most half the poll interval in all, and
//     once an export to a Collector is blocked, calls stop waiting for
//     theirs to the same Collector.
//   - An export that ends with an error (a request the Collector rejected
//     for good) fails the next call of its log type, which reads the batch
//     again, as a failed export always has.
//
// The batches held at once, read, being exported or pending, are bounded by
// [Executor.MaxHeldBytes] of row data, so a backlog in every log type while
// the Collector is blocked cannot exhaust the collector's memory: past it, a
// log type reads a smaller batch, and once less than [minBatchBytes] is
// left, it reads nothing and is blocked too until an export ends.

// DefaultMaxHeldBytes bounds the row data of every batch the executor holds
// at once: eight batches of [DefaultMaxBatchBytes], as many as eight targets
// extracting at once.
