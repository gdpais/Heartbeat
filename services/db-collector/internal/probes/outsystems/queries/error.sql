-- The error log: one row per logged exception, written from the OutSystems 11 Log data reference
-- (view oslog_Error); column names and types checked against the logging-database
-- survey [3.3].
--
-- oslog_Error is a view over the current week's cycle table and
-- oslog_Error_Previous over last week's; the platform switches them every
-- Friday at 23:45 (database time). Reading both keeps the rows logged just
-- before a rotation and lets initial_lookback reach back a week.
-- Columns that differ between the log views are returned under the standard
-- names of README.md (Standard columns).
-- Entrypoint_Name is the entry point (standard name Screen). Module_Name is
-- the free text the error was logged with, Espace_Name the module.
