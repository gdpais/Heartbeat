# Walkthrough: Run and Test Heartbeat on kind

A guided first run of the full stack on your machine, about 30 minutes.
Each step says what to run and what you should see. The
[local development guide](local-development.md) is the reference for the same
commands; [Kubernetes delivery](kubernetes-local.md) explains what the chart
deploys.

## 1. Prepare your machine

| Need | Version | macOS (Homebrew) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine on Linux) | any current release; cgroup v2 | `brew install --cask docker` |
| kind | v0.33.x | `brew install kind` |
| kubectl | 1.35–1.37 | `brew install kubectl` |
| Helm | 4.2 or later | `brew install helm` |
| Go | 1.27+ | `brew install go` |
| jq, openssl, curl | any | `brew install jq` (openssl and curl ship with macOS) |

Docker settings:

- Give Docker at least **4 CPUs and 6 GB of memory**. The full profile uses
  about 2 GB, SQL Server about 1 GB, and image builds need headroom.
- On Apple silicon, enable **Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation**. SQL
  Server only ships an AMD64 image.
- These ports must be free on 127.0.0.1: 3000, 4317, 4318, 8082, 8083, 9090,
  9093 and 11433.

Then, from the repository root:

```bash
make tools-check
```

Every line should start with `ok`. Any `FAIL` line says what to install or
change.

## 2. Start the platform

```bash
make chart-deps   # downloads the pinned Prometheus, Grafana, Loki and OTel charts
make kind-up      # creates the "heartbeat" cluster, builds and loads images, deploys
```

The first `make kind-up` takes several minutes while Docker pulls the node and
engine images. It ends by listing pods and services; all seven pods should be
`1/1 Running`:

```text
alertmanager-0, db-collector-0, grafana-…, loki-0, otel-collector-…, otel-gateway-…, prometheus-…
```

Check the endpoints:

```bash
make health
```

Each check prints a body; the command fails on the first one that does not
answer.

## 3. Look around

| Open | What you should see |
| --- | --- |
| http://localhost:3000 (Grafana, `admin`/`admin`) | Dashboards → **Heartbeat** folder with *Heartbeat Overview* and *SQL Server Overview*; Connections → Data sources lists Prometheus and Loki |
| http://localhost:9090/targets (Prometheus) | Six jobs, all **UP**: alertmanager, db-collector, loki, otel-collector, otel-gateway, prometheus |
| http://localhost:9090/alerts | **Watchdog** firing. It always fires; that is how a dead-man's switch knows alerting works |
| http://localhost:9093 (Alertmanager) | The Watchdog alert, received from Prometheus |
| http://localhost:8082/readyz | `{"status":"ready"}`; the details need the admin token (next section) |

So far the collector monitors nothing: the default config has no SQL Server
targets.

## 4. Add a SQL Server target

```bash
make sqlserver-dev-init   # once: writes .env.sqlserver-dev with a random SA password
make sqlserver-dev-up     # starts SQL Server in Docker, creates the credential Secret, redeploys
```

The first run pulls the SQL Server image (about 1.5 GB). The container,
`heartbeat-sqlserver-dev`, runs next to the cluster, not in it, and the
collector reaches it by name. Within a minute:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer local-admin-token" localhost:8082/admin/config |
  jq '{version, status: .readiness.status, targets: [.readiness.collectors[].targets[] | {name, state}]}'
```

shows the target `sqlserver-dev` with `"state": "ok"`. Then:

- In Prometheus, query `heartbeat_collector_target_up`: value `1` for
  `target="sqlserver-dev"`.
- In Grafana, open *SQL Server Overview* and pick `sqlserver-dev`. The panels
  fill in as samples arrive (15s scrape interval).

## 5. Change the config without a restart

The collector hot-reloads `integrations.yaml`. Note the current version, then
deploy a change (here, a 30s scrape interval):

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer local-admin-token" localhost:8082/admin/config | jq -r .version
mkdir -p .tmp
sed 's/scrape_interval: 15s/scrape_interval: 30s/' infra/helm/values/sqlserver-dev.yaml > .tmp/my-values.yaml
EXTRA_VALUES=.tmp/my-values.yaml make kind-deploy
```

Run the first command again until the version changes. It usually takes 10
to 60 seconds: kubelet updates the mounted ConfigMap, then the collector polls
it every 5s. Confirm the pod was not replaced: its AGE keeps counting.

```bash
kubectl --context kind-heartbeat -n heartbeat get pod db-collector-0
```

To apply a config change immediately instead of waiting:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer local-admin-token" localhost:8082/admin/config/reload
```

`make kind-deploy` without `EXTRA_VALUES` puts the 15s interval back.

## 6. Break the database, not the collector

```bash
docker stop heartbeat-sqlserver-dev
```

Within about 20 seconds `GET /admin/config` shows the target as `"failed"`,
with the driver's error, but the collector itself stays `ready` (`/readyz`
answers 200), and Prometheus shows
`heartbeat_collector_target_up` at `0`. The collector is not restarted: a
database outage must never take down monitoring.

```bash
docker start heartbeat-sqlserver-dev
```

The target returns to `"ok"` within about 30 seconds of SQL Server accepting
connections.

## 7. Ship a code change

Change something in `services/db-collector` (even a log message), then:

```bash
make kind-images kind-deploy
kubectl --context kind-heartbeat -n heartbeat get pod db-collector-0 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}'
```

The image tag (`heartbeat/db-collector:dev-<id>`) changes with the binary, and
the collector is replaced by a new pod. The old pod stops before the new one
starts, so the database is never polled twice.

## 8. Try the small profile

```bash
PROFILE=minimal make kind-deploy   # collector, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana only
make kind-deploy                   # back to the full profile
```

## 9. Run the automated acceptance checks

```bash
make kind-e2e
```

This creates a second, temporary cluster (`heartbeat-e2e-<id>`) with its own
SQL Server, runs every check above and more (invalid config, rollouts,
persistence after pod replacement), prints measurements, and deletes what it
created. Your `heartbeat` cluster is untouched. It takes about 10 minutes and
ends with `All kind e2e checks passed`. CI runs the same script on every pull
request.

## 10. Clean up

```bash
make sqlserver-dev-down   # removes the SQL Server container and its data, redeploys without it
make kind-down            # deletes the cluster
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| `make tools-check` reports a wrong kubectl | Another kubectl (often Docker Desktop's) is earlier in `PATH`; put Homebrew's first |
| `make kind-up` fails with `port is already allocated` | Something else holds one of the ports above (often an old Compose stack: `docker compose ls`). Stop it and rerun |
| kind node fails with a cgroup v1 error | kubelet 1.36 needs cgroup v2. Docker Desktop has it; on Linux, use a distribution with cgroup v2 |
| Pods stay `ErrImageNeverPull` | The images were not loaded into this cluster (for example after recreating it by hand). Run `make kind-images kind-deploy` |
| `make health` or the browser get "connection reset" right after Docker or the laptop restarts | kube-proxy inside the node is still starting. Wait a minute and retry |
| Image pulls fail with `429 Too Many Requests` | Docker Hub's anonymous rate limit. `docker login`, wait, and rerun |
| SQL Server never becomes healthy on Apple silicon | Rosetta emulation is off in Docker Desktop, or Docker has too little memory |
| `helm upgrade` fails with a field-manager conflict | Something was edited by hand with `kubectl`. See [Kubernetes delivery](kubernetes-local.md#working-with-it) |
