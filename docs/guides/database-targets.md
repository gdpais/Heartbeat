# Onboarding SQL Server Targets

How to add, change or remove a monitored SQL Server database.

Monitored targets are configured in `config/integrations.yaml`, not in
PostgreSQL or a UI. Onboarding a database is a config change
([ADR 0002](../architecture/decisions/0002-runtime-config-in-yaml.md)). All keys
are described in the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md).

SQL Server is the only supported engine. Adding PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle or
MongoDB targets requires a new collector kind and connector in code, not just
config.

## 1. Get a login from the DBAs

Production targets use a dedicated observability login, never `sa` or any other
sysadmin login.

### Collector login permissions

The built-in probes need SQL Server 2012 or later (the newest feature they use
is `CONCAT`); CI runs them against SQL Server 2022 on Linux. They are read-only
and need:

| Permission | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| `VIEW SERVER STATE` | `sys.dm_os_wait_stats`, `sys.dm_exec_requests`, `sys.dm_exec_sessions`, `sys.dm_os_performance_counters`, `sys.dm_os_ring_buffers`, `sys.dm_os_sys_info`, `sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats`. Every built-in probe was verified as a login holding only `VIEW SERVER STATE` and `VIEW ANY DEFINITION`. SQL Server 2022's narrower `VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE` has not been verified on its own, so grant `VIEW SERVER STATE`. |
| `VIEW ANY DEFINITION` | `sys.master_files` for the `storage` and `file_io` probes. Without it, file sizes and file I/O are silently missing. |
| `VIEW ANY DATABASE` (granted to `public` by default) | Database names (`DB_NAME()`) in the `storage` and `file_io` `database_name` label. If it was revoked, files of databases the login cannot see are labelled `database_id:<id>` instead. |
| Access to the target's `database_name` | Used as the initial database |

No write, `db_owner` or `sysadmin` rights are required. `make test-sqlserver`
and `make kind-e2e` run every built-in probe as a login holding only these
grants. A `query_template` override runs with the same login; review it against
the [probe review checklist](../architecture/database-observability.md#probe-review-checklist),
and with the DBAs first if it needs more than these permissions. The collector
rejects an override that is not one read-only `SELECT`
([rules](../reference/configuration.md#collectors)), but that text check is
only a safety net: these read-only grants are what stop a probe from changing
anything, so never give the collector's login write rights.

For the DBAs, the T-SQL for such a login (SQL Server authentication; pick
your own name and a strong password):

```sql
USE master;  -- server permissions are granted from master
CREATE LOGIN heartbeat_collector WITH PASSWORD = N'<password>';
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO heartbeat_collector;
GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO heartbeat_collector;

-- Check: both columns must be 0.
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = N'heartbeat_collector';
SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER(N'sysadmin') AS is_sysadmin,
       HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME(NULL, NULL, N'CONTROL SERVER') AS has_control_server;
REVERT;

-- Only when the target's database_name is not master: a user there, with no roles.
USE FinanceDB;
CREATE USER heartbeat_collector FOR LOGIN heartbeat_collector;
```

[`scripts/sqlserver-login.sh`](../../scripts/sqlserver-login.sh) creates the
same login in the local sandbox, and refuses one that ends up
sysadmin-equivalent.

If the login is sysadmin-equivalent anyway (a member of `sysadmin`, or
holding `CONTROL SERVER`), the collector logs a warning (with the target and
`credential_ref`) and exports `heartbeat_collector_target_login_sysadmin` as
`1` ([metrics reference](../reference/metrics-and-endpoints.md#collector-self-observability)).
It checks when it first connects to the target and about every 10 minutes
after, so a change to the login's rights shows up within that time. If SQL
Server cannot tell, the collector logs that once per check and exports no
value. The `HeartbeatCollectorLoginElevated` alert fires when the metric has
been `1` for 15 minutes.

### Certificates

Connections use `encrypt=true` and verify the server's certificate. It must be
issued for the target's `host` and chain to a public CA in the collector's
image (Debian's `ca-certificates`). Otherwise every probe fails:
`x509: certificate is not valid for any names, but wanted to match <host>` for
SQL Server's default self-signed certificate, or
`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`. Trusting a private CA is not
supported yet: the chart has no setting to add one to the collector.

The chart value `dbCollector.sqlserver.trustServerCertificate: true` (the
variable `HEARTBEAT_DB_COLLECTOR_SQLSERVER_TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE`) turns
verification off. It is for the local dev container only: it applies to every
target, and the collector logs a warning at startup and lists it in
`GET /admin/config`.

### OutSystems logging database

An `outsystems_logs` collector reads the OutSystems 11 logging database with
its own login, which needs `SELECT` on the `oslog_*` views its log-type
queries read (`oslog_<TYPE>` and `oslog_<TYPE>_Previous`; the views and their
cycle tables share an owner, so no grant on the tables), access to that
database, and nothing else: no server permission. `make test-sqlserver` runs
every log-type query as such a login.
It runs the same login check and session settings as below. Settings are in
the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#outsystems_logs-collectors).

### What the collector runs on the server

- At most 2 sessions per target, with the application name
  `HeartbeatDBCollector`.
- When it first connects to a target, and about every 10 minutes after, one
  `SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin'), HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME(NULL, NULL,
  'CONTROL SERVER')`. It needs no extra permission.
- Each probe query, in one batch prefixed with
  `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT 1000; SET DEADLOCK_PRIORITY LOW;`. A probe waits at most
  1 second for a lock, then fails with error 1222 for that cycle (logged, the
  target is reported failed and retried on the next cycle). In a deadlock with
  an application session at the default (`NORMAL`) or a higher priority, SQL
  Server picks the collector as the victim; against another `LOW` session it
  picks the one cheaper to roll back, which for a read-only probe is usually
  the collector. `query_template` overrides get the same prefix, so a
  template must be a query, not a bare stored procedure name (see the
  [probe review checklist](../architecture/database-observability.md#probe-review-checklist)).

1 second is well below the default probe timeout (half the scrape interval, at
most 10 seconds), so a lock wait fails fast with a specific error instead of
holding a place in the lock queue, ahead of application requests, until the
probe deadline.

## 2. Add the target

Add an entry under `collectors[].config.targets[]` of the environment's
`integrations` values (the chart renders them into `integrations.yaml`; see
[config by environment](../reference/configuration.md#config-files-by-environment)).
Lists replace rather than merge across values files, so restate the whole
`collectors` list:

```yaml
collectors:
  - id: sqlserver-default
    kind: sqlserver
    enabled: true
    config:
      environment: prod
      scrape_interval: 30s
      probes:
        - name: waits
        - name: blocking
        - name: sessions
        - name: memory_pressure
        - name: storage
        - name: throughput
        - name: cpu
        - name: buffer_cache
        - name: file_io
      targets:
        - name: finance-prod          # becomes the `target` label; unique per collector
          host: finance-sql.internal
          port: 1433
          database_name: FinanceDB
          credential_ref: env/finance-prod
```

To run only some targets of a collector, list them in `config.target_names`.

To **change** a target, edit its entry: `host`/`port` for a new server,
`database_name` for another database on the same server, `credential_ref` for a
new login. To **remove** one, delete the entry; the collector stops exporting
its series after the reload.

## 3. Provide the credential

`credential_ref: env/finance-prod` is read from the environment variable
`HEARTBEAT_CREDENTIAL_ENV_FINANCE_PROD` with the value `username:password`
([resolution rules](../reference/configuration.md#credential-resolution)). The
variable must reach the collector **container**. Keep values out of version
control.

Put the variable in a Secret and name it in
`dbCollector.credentials.existingSecret`; the chart loads every key of that
Secret into the collector's environment.

| Where the collector runs | How the Secret is created |
| --- | --- |
| kind | `kubectl -n heartbeat create secret generic <name> --from-literal=HEARTBEAT_CREDENTIAL_ENV_FINANCE_PROD=<user>:<password>` |
| kind SQL Server sandbox | Already wired: `make sqlserver-dev-up` creates it from the ignored `.env.sqlserver-dev` |
| Production | An External Secrets Operator `ExternalSecret` from AWS Secrets Manager (ADR 0005) |

## 4. Apply the change

| Where | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| kind | Put the values in a file and run `EXTRA_VALUES=<file> make kind-deploy`. |
| Installed from a release | Put the values in a file and run `helm upgrade` with it and all your other values files ([installing a release](install-from-release.md#5-add-a-sql-server-target)). |
| Production | Commit the values to the `heartbeat-deploy` repository; Argo CD syncs them. |

Helm rejects values that fail the integrations schema before anything changes.
A config-only change does not restart the collector: the ConfigMap reaches the
pod within about a minute (kubelet sync) and the collector picks it up through
file polling (5s). To apply it sooner, `POST /admin/config/reload` with the
admin token. A change to the credentials Secret needs
`kubectl -n heartbeat rollout restart statefulset/db-collector`. An invalid file
is rejected and the previous config keeps running, so the change has not
taken effect: step 5 shows how to tell.

## 5. Verify

First check that the collector took the change. Helm accepting the values
does not mean the collector did: it also checks host names, credential
references, intervals and probe names.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8082/metrics | grep '^heartbeat_collector_config_'
```

`heartbeat_collector_config_last_reload_successful` should be `1`, and
`heartbeat_collector_config_info` should show a new `version`. At `0` the
change was rejected and the last good config still runs, and after 2
minutes Prometheus fires `HeartbeatCollectorConfigReloadFailed`, so a
rejection shows in alerting even when nobody runs this check
([config reload metrics](../reference/metrics-and-endpoints.md#config-reloads)).
The reason is `last_reload_err` in `GET /admin/config` and in the pod log; fix
the values and apply them again.

Then check the target:

```bash
# The header goes to curl on stdin, so the token stays off its command line.
printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s\n' "$HEARTBEAT_ADMIN_TOKEN" | curl -s -H @- http://localhost:8082/admin/config |
  jq '.readiness.collectors[].targets[] | select(.name == "finance-prod")'   # state, and the driver error if it fails
curl -s http://localhost:8082/metrics | grep 'heartbeat_collector_target_up{.*target="finance-prod"'
```

`heartbeat_collector_target_up` should be `1`, and
`heartbeat_sqlserver_*` series should appear with `target="finance-prod"`. In
Grafana, open the *SQL Server overview* dashboard and select the target.

If the target stays down, the target's `error` above shows the driver's
message (login, host or certificate); the collector's JSON logs have one line
per probe failure, with collector, target and probe. Repeated failures back off
exponentially up to 5 minutes, so a fix can take that long to show up unless
you reload.
