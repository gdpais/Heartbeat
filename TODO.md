# TODO

Single source of truth for delivery order and task status. The
[roadmap](docs/product/roadmap.md) summarizes this checklist by phase; the
original plan this list was derived from is
[archived](docs/archive/2026-05-30-mvp-implementation-plan.md).

Core delivery order: **DB collector → OutSystems ingest → API/control plane → Web UI**,
after foundations and schema prerequisites (sections 2–5). Later-service
integrations are explicitly identified below; they do not block independent
stage work, but they do block end-to-end completion of the dependent feature.
Stage 3 does not wait for stage 2's release: its decisions are recorded
(ADRs 0013–0017) and its prerequisites are done, so it starts while the
release waits for the release app [0.5].

Test each implementation action as it lands. Section 16 is a shared validation
inventory used throughout delivery, not a final testing stage. Remaining
delivery order after the Web UI: production delivery [18] → product workflows
[10–11] → investigations, alerting and reporting, with their APIs [4.6–4.8,
6, 7, 12–14] → advanced
reliability [19] → fallback ingestion [20] → Oracle integration, gated by an
Alloy coverage check [21] → final Alloy comparison [22].

## 0. Cross-cutting foundations

### 0.1 Product and architecture baseline
- [x] Write product and architecture baseline docs ([docs index](docs/README.md))
- [x] Design current-runtime and target-architecture diagrams, link them from the README, and verify them against source/configuration
- [x] Reorganize docs by audience; record key decisions as ADRs; archive superseded plans
- [x] Reorder delivery: collector → gateway → API → Web; production delivery after the Web UI; Oracle after fallback ingestion and gated by an Alloy coverage check; Alloy comparison last
- [x] Keep the observability platform replaceable: services emit only OTLP and Prometheus exposition, neutral integrations config, an external-platform values example ([ADR 0011](docs/architecture/decisions/0011-platform-agnostic-telemetry-boundary.md))
- [x] Freeze subsystem boundaries, responsibilities, and interfaces ([ADR 0013](docs/architecture/decisions/0013-api-design-and-subsystem-boundaries.md))
- [x] Freeze ownership rules ([ADR 0013](docs/architecture/decisions/0013-api-design-and-subsystem-boundaries.md)):
  - [x] app-owned workflows derive environment through `applications.environment_id`
  - [x] PostgreSQL stores control-plane metadata only
  - [x] YAML/Kubernetes stores integration + collector desired runtime config
  - [x] The observability platform (Prometheus and Loki when bundled) stores telemetry data
  - [x] Redis stores transient state only: job delivery, locks, caches, login sessions

### 0.2 Repo and local platform bootstrap
- [x] Create monorepo scaffolding
- [x] Add local Docker Compose stack for:
  - [x] PostgreSQL
  - [x] Redis
  - [x] Prometheus
  - [x] Loki
  - [x] Grafana
  - [x] Alertmanager
  - [x] OpenTelemetry Collector
- [x] Document local dev health checks in `docs/guides/local-development.md`
- [x] Add GitHub Actions CI for Go tests and Docker Compose validation
- [x] Isolate Docker integration tests from the developer stack and concurrent test runs
- [x] Make both application Dockerfiles platform-aware (ARM64 and AMD64)

### 0.3 Shared contracts and conventions
- [x] Create `packages/config-schema/`
- [x] Create `packages/telemetry-contracts/`
- [x] Define normalized telemetry contract
- [x] Define session investigation query/result contract
- [x] Define alert evidence payload contract
- [x] Define reporting payload contract
- [x] Define integration YAML schema

### 0.4 Kubernetes delivery: kind and CI

Production delivery is section 18.

- [x] Assess the Compose-to-kind migration and choose shared Helm delivery ([ADR 0003](docs/architecture/decisions/0003-helm-on-kind-and-production.md))
- [x] Decide platform (AWS EKS), deploy mechanism (Argo CD), registry (ECR), secrets (AWS Secrets Manager + ESO), version policy, alert channels incl. WhatsApp, dead-man's switch and Grafana access ([ADR 0005](docs/architecture/decisions/0005-production-delivery-and-operations-defaults.md))
- [x] Pin tools to the EKS-supported minor (kind node v1.36.4, kubectl 1.35–1.37, Helm 4.2, Go 1.27.1); add `make tools-check`
- [x] Bump engines to latest stable under Compose first (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager, otelcol); add Renovate
- [x] Build the Helm chart and kind workflow; adapt Make and CI; pass the ADR 0003 acceptance criteria (`make chart-check`, `make kind-e2e`; evidence in ADR 0003)
- [x] Retire the platform Compose definition and the Kustomize bundle
- [x] Install the Renovate GitHub App on the repository (config is in `renovate.json`); its [dependency dashboard](https://github.com/gdpais/Heartbeat/issues/86) lists the detected dependencies and the majors awaiting approval
- [ ] Agree the local loop's time and resource budget (measured: about 2.0 GiB RAM for the full profile)
- [x] Cap the sandbox SQL Server's memory (`MSSQL_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` in `scripts/kind.sh` and `scripts/sqlserver-test.sh`), so that a load flood or a second cluster slows it down instead of getting it killed; on 2026-10-22 it was killed twice on an 8 GB Docker host, once under a PatientZero load flood and once when a second cluster started. 2048 MB by default, SQL Server's minimum (`SQLSERVER_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`); an existing container keeps the cap it was created with, and `make sqlserver-dev-up` warns when it differs ([sandbox](docs/guides/local-development.md#sql-server-sandbox))
- [x] Reject unknown keys inside each component's chart values (`dbCollector.enabeld` was ignored): `dbCollector`, `otelCollectorQueue`, `grafanaDashboards` and the two security contexts now list every key, so a misspelt one fails; `integrations`, `prometheusRules` and `backendNetworkPolicies` already did. The bundled engines' values stay their charts' own

### 0.5 Development workflow and releases

Trunk-based development and tagged releases ([ADR 0006](docs/architecture/decisions/0006-trunk-based-development-and-tagged-releases.md));
the rules are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- [x] Decide the branching, versioning, release and changelog model; add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`
- [x] Retire the `db-collectors` phase branch, its ruleset and its CI push trigger
- [x] Release workflows: release-please keeps a release pull request (`CHANGELOG.md`, `version.txt`, chart `version`/`appVersion`); a `vX.Y.Z` tag on `master` that passed CI publishes multi-arch images and the chart to GHCR and lists their digests in the GitHub release
- [x] Change-based CI: slow jobs run only when a change can affect them, every job on `master`; one required check, `ci-ok` ([ADR 0007](docs/architecture/decisions/0007-change-based-ci-with-one-required-check.md))
- [x] Switch the `master` ruleset's required checks from `test`, `Helm chart` and `kind end-to-end` to `ci-ok`
- [x] Pin GitHub Actions by commit SHA, kept current by Renovate; `make test` fails on an unpinned `uses:` ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#ci)).
- [ ] At the end of phase 2: create the release GitHub App; set `RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` ([setup](CONTRIBUTING.md#releases)). Until then the release-please job is skipped and no releases are cut, not even by hand; the first release pull request then covers every Conventional Commit since `v0.1.0`
- [ ] At `1.0.0`, the first production release: remove `"prerelease": true` from `release-please-config.json`
- [x] Tag ruleset on all tags (not only `v*`, so later component tags are covered): no updates or deletions
- [ ] Right after the release app exists: add a second tag ruleset on all tags, `Heartbeat-tag-creation`, with only *Restrict creations* and the release app in its bypass list, so the app can create tags but not move or delete them ([setup](CONTRIBUTING.md#releases))
- [x] First release, `v0.1.0`: tag the phase 1 merge commit `64ac1b6`, run the `release` workflow by hand for it, check the release notes list three digests
- [x] Make the GHCR packages public: `heartbeat/db-collector`, `charts/heartbeat`, and `heartbeat/otel-gateway`, which only `v0.1.0` uses. Checked 2026-10-23 without credentials: an anonymous token from `ghcr.io/token` pulls each `0.1.0` manifest (HTTP 200; 403 for a package that does not exist)
- [x] Make the published release installable (usability test of `v0.1.0`, 2026-10-22): the chart defaults to the GHCR image, kept in step with `release.yml` by a test; `NOTES.txt` names the Secrets the chart needs and how to check the install; a chart README for `helm show readme`; the [install guide](docs/guides/install-from-release.md) covers the Secrets, image digests, SQL Server targets through `helm upgrade`, upgrades and what `helm uninstall` leaves behind; T-SQL for the collector login
- [x] Collector StatefulSet on `podManagementPolicy: Parallel`, so a corrected upgrade replaces a pod that never became Ready; an install from `0.1.0` deletes the StatefulSet once with `--cascade=orphan` ([upgrade](docs/guides/install-from-release.md#upgrade); `scripts/kind.sh` does it on kind); `make kind-e2e` checks both
- [x] Chart schema rejects unknown top-level values, so a misspelt key fails instead of being ignored

---

## 1. Core system: PostgreSQL metadata and schema

  - [x] raw telemetry
  - [x] raw logs
  - [x] raw sessions/session identity mappings
  - [x] report binaries
  - [x] `outsystems_sources`
  - [x] collector desired runtime state
  - [x] `collector_instances`
  - [x] `collector_assignments`
- [x] Defer asset/topology schema unless SQL Server topology work truly needs it:
  - [x] `assets`
  - [x] `asset_relationships`
  - [x] `applications.primary_asset_id`
  - [x] `application_components.asset_id`

### 1.4 Schema verification

## 2. Core system: DB collector (`services/db-collector`)

Delivery stage 1. Runtime collection can proceed using YAML configuration without
API/UI. Requires shared config/schema [0.3, 8.1–8.2] and Prometheus wiring [9.1].
Probe assignments from API/PostgreSQL [2.5] are a stage-3 integration task, not a
collector-stage completion prerequisite. Query safety [2.2] and endpoint
security [2.7] must pass before live validation against a shared target; do not
defer them to general hardening [15.2].

Remaining work, in order: endpoint security [2.7] → least privilege and query
safety [2.2] → metric types and self-metrics [2.4, 2.6] → core CPU, cache and
I/O signals [2.3]. Evidence publication moved to the investigation track [12.4]:
its consumer and storage design live there, and today's evidence is only a row
count.

- [x] Validate this stage: connector/probe/config/metric tests, safe non-production SQL queries, and live SQL Server → collector → Prometheus → Grafana on kind, including reloads and target outages, with the collector logged in as a least-privilege login [16.1–16.2]

### 2.1 Service bootstrap
- [x] Create Go service entrypoint `services/db-collector/cmd/db-collector/`
- [x] Create internal packages for config, collectors, SQL Server connectors, probes, export
- [x] Add health/metrics/logging/graceful shutdown

### 2.2 SQL Server connectivity and safety
- [x] Implement secure SQL Server connector manager
- [x] Enforce least-privilege credentials: run `make test-sqlserver` and `make kind-e2e` as a login holding only the documented grants (`VIEW SERVER STATE`, `VIEW ANY DEFINITION`), not `sa`
- [x] Warn at startup, in the log and a metric, when the collector login is `sysadmin`
- [x] Set `LOCK_TIMEOUT` and `DEADLOCK_PRIORITY LOW` on every collector session so a probe never waits on locks or wins a deadlock against the application
- [x] Enforce query timeout/budget guards
- [x] Pool SQL Server connections per target
- [x] Review all production queries for non-blocking behavior
- [x] Define safe probe review/versioning process: write the probe review checklist now; probe versioning comes with API probe definitions [4.5]

### 2.3 Probe implementation
- [x] Implement waits probes
- [x] Implement locks/blocking probes
- [x] Implement sessions/connections probes
- [x] Implement memory pressure probes
- [x] Implement storage probes
- [x] Implement throughput/latency probes as needed
- [x] Replace generic column-to-metric decoding with explicit per-probe metric descriptors
- [x] Fix the `throughput` probe's duplicate `Transactions/sec` series and padded `counter_name` labels; check `memory_pressure` for the same padding ([#4](https://github.com/gdpais/Heartbeat/issues/4))
- [x] Run every built-in probe against a real SQL Server in CI (`make test-sqlserver`): no duplicate series, no padded label values
- [x] Add core signals before the first production deploy (after counter support [2.4]): CPU utilisation, page life expectancy and buffer cache hit ratio, file I/O from `sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats`; dashboard panels for each. The rest of the signal set stays in [11.2]

### 2.4 Metrics and evidence output
- [x] Normalize SQL Server outputs into Prometheus-friendly metrics
- [x] Expose scrape endpoint
- [x] Produce structured evidence for blocking/session probes
- [x] Export cumulative SQL Server values (waits, throughput counters) as counters that tolerate SQL Server restarts, renamed to Prometheus conventions (`_total` suffix, seconds rather than ms, e.g. `heartbeat_sqlserver_wait_seconds_total`); update rules, rule tests and dashboards to rates in the same change
- [x] Keep DB collector metric output stateless and Prometheus-scraped instead of persisted in PostgreSQL
- [x] Add collector self-observability: per-probe duration histogram, and Go runtime and process metrics on the collector's registry

### 2.5 Runtime config model
- [x] Read desired runtime collector config from `config/integrations.yaml`
- [x] Read active target/probe runtime config from YAML/Kubernetes convention
- [ ] Reintroduce API/PostgreSQL-driven probe assignments only after the control-plane workflow exists: approved assignments render to a generated values file proposed as a pull request to `heartbeat-deploy` ([ADR 0014](docs/architecture/decisions/0014-probe-assignments-to-runtime-config.md))
- [x] Chart key `managedCollectors`, appended to `integrations.collectors`; hand-written collector IDs may not start with `api-` ([ADR 0014](docs/architecture/decisions/0014-probe-assignments-to-runtime-config.md))
- [x] Resolve credentials from mounted Secret files, so a new or rotated credential needs no collector restart ([ADR 0002](docs/architecture/decisions/0002-runtime-config-in-yaml.md) follow-up, [ADR 0014](docs/architecture/decisions/0014-probe-assignments-to-runtime-config.md))
- [x] Keep desired state out of PostgreSQL

### 2.6 Collector reliability baseline

Replica ownership and outage testing are section 19. Design details:
[Collector recovery and high availability](docs/architecture/database-observability.md#collector-recovery-and-high-availability-planned).

- [x] Align SQL Server Prometheus recording-rule names with the current probe catalog; validate the rules against emitted metrics (promtool unit tests in `make rules-check`, Go test for metric-name drift)
- [x] Document the planned HA improvements and the Alloy comparison in architecture and roadmap docs
- [x] Isolate probe/target failures so one failed target cannot stop unrelated collection
- [x] Retry transient collection failures with bounded exponential backoff and jitter; expose persistent failures without retry storms
- [x] Expose per-target success, consecutive failures, last-success time, and freshness; expire stale/removed metric series
- [x] Add per-probe cumulative error counters
- [x] Make readiness reflect expected collector state and add deployment health probes and restart/recovery policies
- [x] Validate safe reloads, including partial reconciliation failure (rollback) and replacement-poller startup failure (unit-tested)
- [x] Bound every probe with a hard deadline so a probe the driver cannot cancel never stalls the collector cycle; keep at most one abandoned call per target and bound dead connections with a driver socket timeout
- [x] Per-probe failure isolation: a failing probe fails only itself (it failed its whole target for that cycle, and its backoff stopped every probe of the target). While other probes of the target succeed, the target is `degraded`, stays up and keeps collecting, and the failing probe backs off on its own; the target fails and backs off as a whole only when every probe that ran failed. `heartbeat_collector_probe_up` per probe, `targets_degraded` and each failing probe in `GET /admin/config`
- [x] Cap the rows a probe reads (`max_rows`, default 10,000) and fail the probe past the cap, so a `query_template` that returns millions of rows cannot run the pod out of memory; `outsystems_logs` reads are already bounded by `batch_limit`
- [x] A global series budget per collector with an overflow counter: the per-label caps on applications, modules and operations multiply, so the worst case had no bound. An `outsystems_logs` collector holds at most `max_derived_series` derived series, counted as Prometheus stores them (a proposed 50,000: 29 times PatientZero's production-sized profile, about 33 MiB); past it a row that needs a new series is left out of that metric and counted in `heartbeat_outsystems_derived_series_overflow_total`, series that exist keep counting, `OutSystemsDerivedSeriesOverflow` fires, and the budget is freed with the series when the collector stops. The `sqlserver` kind's probe series are already bounded by `max_rows` and replaced every cycle, so the budget covers the derived metrics only

### 2.7 Collector endpoint security
- [x] Diagnostics: require the admin token for `GET /admin/config`; keep `/readyz` to status only and move raw driver errors (host, port, login) behind auth
- [x] Redaction: mask notification channel `config` values in `Redacted()`, strip userinfo from endpoint URLs, and reject credentials embedded in `loki`/`alertmanager` URLs at validation
- [x] Admin token: compare in constant time
- [x] Network exposure: add a NetworkPolicy limiting port 8082 to Prometheus and operator access
- [x] SQL Server TLS: log a startup warning and surface in diagnostics when `TrustServerCertificate` is enabled; per-target TLS settings wait until a real target needs them
- [x] Check at validation that a `query_template` is a single read-only `SELECT` (defense in depth; the read-only login stays the control)
- [x] Egress NetworkPolicy for the collector: DNS, the monitored targets and the OTel Collector only (the policy restricted ingress only). `dbCollector.networkPolicy.egress`, off by default (NetworkPolicy cannot match the targets' host names, so their addresses are given as peers), on in `kind.yaml` and the production example; the targets' ports come from `integrations`, an install with targets but no target peers fails, and `make kind-e2e` checks, from an ephemeral container in the collector's pod, that it reaches only DNS and the OTel Collector
- [x] A NodePort or LoadBalancer Service bypasses the collector's NetworkPolicy, so the unauthenticated `/metrics` (collector, target and environment names, probe counters) reaches anything that can reach a node. The chart default is ClusterIP and kind binds its node port to 127.0.0.1 only; the chart values (`dbCollector.service.type`), the [network access](docs/guides/kubernetes-local.md#network-access) guide and the install guide say production keeps ClusterIP

---

## 3. Core system: OutSystems ingest

Delivery stage 2. The first deployment is OutSystems 11 self-managed: its logs
are extracted from the logging database by a new db-collector kind,
`outsystems_logs`
([ADR 0008](docs/architecture/decisions/0008-outsystems-11-log-extraction.md),
design in [application observability](docs/architecture/application-observability.md)).
Use explicitly configured application/environment identities until API
inventory exists; API-managed onboarding [4.4, 10.1] follows in stage 3.
Generic source expansion [3.4] remains later work. Grafana dashboards [10.4]
follow the ingest path.

Remaining work, in order: the first green nightly run of the scenarios
workflow [16.5] → this stage's validation → the release [0.5]. The signal gaps
the PatientZero scenarios found are closed [3.3, 9.1], and the workflow is on
`master` since 2026-10-27. Not part of this exit, and done alongside stage 3 before
the first production deploy [18]: a series
budget [2.6], collector egress and exposure [2.7], unknown keys in component
values [0.4], Alertmanager's rollout policy [9.4] and PatientZero's hardening
[16.5].

- [ ] Validate this stage: every log-type query against a SQL Server fixture with the `oslog_*` tables, extraction → OTel Collector → Loki and derived metrics → Prometheus on kind, restarts and outages without gaps [16.1–16.2]; Tempo and request traces are not part of this exit [3.6]

### 3.1 OTel gateway bootstrap (service removed, [ADR 0009](docs/architecture/decisions/0009-remove-the-otel-gateway.md))
- [x] Create Go service entrypoint `services/otel-gateway/cmd/otel-gateway/`
- [x] Create internal packages for parsers and normalization
- [x] Add health/metrics/logging/graceful shutdown

### 3.2 Collector-first integration
- [x] Configure stock OpenTelemetry Collector first
- [x] Keep custom app code thin
- [x] Ensure custom code outputs shared Heartbeat telemetry contract
- [x] Avoid rebuilding OTel Collector behavior in service code

### 3.3 OutSystems 11 log extraction (`outsystems_logs` collector kind)
- [x] Decide the ingest path and where the queries live ([ADR 0008](docs/architecture/decisions/0008-outsystems-11-log-extraction.md)); query contract in [`services/db-collector/internal/probes/outsystems/queries/`](services/db-collector/internal/probes/outsystems/queries/README.md)
- [x] Write the log-type queries (`general`, `error`, `screen`, `integration`, `extension`, `mobile_request`, `request_event`, `cyclic_job`) for Traditional and Reactive apps, from the OutSystems 11 Log data reference, with a fixture and rows each
- [x] Review each log-type query with the probe checklist against the surveyed schema (below): one read-only `SELECT` over the two weekly views each, now cut to `@limit` rows per view before the union, so a backlog no longer costs a read of the whole range (a SQL Server test holds it)
- [x] Measure the eight queries' cost on a production-sized logging database (the checklist's last step): no production database before go-live, so `make patientzero-scale` fills a test one, `patientzero_scale`, with two weeks of the surveyed installation's log (9.8 M rows, 3.0 GB) and measures each query over the busiest minute and 1 h, 1 day and 7 day backlogs; the slowest took 160 ms (error, 7 day backlog) against a 10 s probe deadline ([results](tools/patientzero/README.md#production-sized-logging-database))
- [x] Answer the [open questions](docs/architecture/application-observability.md#open-questions) from the OutSystems 11 docs: `Instant` is the start for screen and timer rows and the end for integration and mobile request rows; `Request_Key` is on all eight current log types; ten weekly cycle tables behind `oslog_<TYPE>` and `oslog_<TYPE>_Previous`, rotated Friday 23:45; the time zone is the servers' own
- [x] Read the current and the previous week's views in every query (no Friday gap) and allow a `lag` per log type for the start-stamped ones (`probes[].lag`); the SQL Server tests load `<log type>.rows.sql` and replay a rotation
- [x] Run [`scripts/outsystems-log-survey.sql`](scripts/outsystems-log-survey.sql) against a real logging database (read only; [ADR 0010](docs/architecture/decisions/0010-patientzero-test-application.md)) and replace the stand-in fixtures with its DDL; the rows stay synthetic. Answers in the [open questions](docs/architecture/application-observability.md#open-questions): `Duration` in milliseconds for screen, integration and extension, about 3,800 rows a minute at peak (the default `batch_limit` covers it)
- [x] The real `oslog_Error` view left-joins `oslog_Error_Detail` and returns its `FullStackTrace` as `Stack`: the fixture has the detail tables and the join, with a trace that lives only in the detail table; PatientZero writes error rows into the current cycle table and traces longer than its `Stack` into the detail table
- [x] Config: `outsystems_logs` kind in the schema and Go config (`probes` select log types; `scrape_interval` is the poll interval; `lag`, `batch_limit`, `initial_lookback`, `log_timezone`)
- [x] Extractor: watermarked reads per target and log type, full-batch tie handling, watermark file on a persistent volume, same session settings, deadline, backoff and readiness as the `sqlserver` kind
- [x] Export OTLP/HTTP logs to the OTel Collector: OutSystems column names as attributes, `Message` body, severity, resource attributes `service.name`, `deployment.environment.name`, `outsystems.log_type`; `error.fingerprint` on error records; watermark moves only after delivery
- [x] Persistent volume for the collector in the chart; NetworkPolicy egress from the collector to the OTel Collector (none needed: the collector's policy restricts ingress only)
- [x] Add `outsystems.log_type` to Loki's index labels
- [x] Extraction self-metrics: rows, lag, export failures, OutSystems log delay
- [x] Derived metrics from the [catalog](docs/architecture/application-observability.md#derived-metrics), with bounded labels; recording rules, SLO burn-rate alerts and promtool tests; a Go test fails when a rule, dashboard or doc names an OutSystems metric the collector does not export
- [x] Active users and sessions, and new error fingerprints: left out of the collector on purpose ([why](docs/architecture/application-observability.md#not-built-on-purpose)); active users come from Loki in the dashboards [10.4], new fingerprints need a persisted fingerprint set first. `make patientzero-scale` simulates them at production cardinality (4,829 users and 13,871 sessions a week, 40 recurring error kinds and 3 new ones a day) with their known answers in `expected.json`
- [x] Lose no logs on a backlog: the production-sized check found rows lost between the OTel Collector and Loki after the db-collector had counted them delivered (out-of-order batches Loki rejects, a batch above its ingestion burst, a batch processor that hid a full queue). The logs exporter now sends in order, retries without a deadline, cuts batches at 4 MiB and has no batch processor in front; a chart test pins it and `LokiDiscardingLogs` warns ([why](docs/architecture/application-observability.md)). The queue is on disk since (next item)
- [x] Persistent sending queue for the logs exporter (`file_storage` on a volume), so a Collector restart loses nothing the db-collector counted delivered; a kind test restarts the Collector during a backlog and compares Loki with the rows read. The stage validation's "restarts without gaps" needs it. The queue is on the `otel-collector-queue` claim and the Collector is a one-replica StatefulSet; `make kind-e2e` restarts it with Loki down and 6,000 queued rows, and Loki ends with each of them once ([why](docs/architecture/application-observability.md)). A 64 MiB queue sent the batches it was sending at a restart last, out of order (1,297 of 6,000 rows over three hours lost in kind); the next item closes it
- [x] Keep the order across a Collector restart: the logs exporter's queue holds one request and the receiver waits for room in it, so nothing queues behind the request being sent. The db-collector waits for the Collector without failing the target: the export runs in the background outside the probe deadline, retried until accepted; the log type reads nothing more meanwhile, its target stays up and `heartbeat_outsystems_export_blocked` is 1; nothing is held on SQL Server and at most 64 MiB of row data in memory. `make kind-e2e` restarts the Collector during 45-minute and three-hour backlogs with Loki down, and Loki ends with every row of both, once ([why](docs/architecture/application-observability.md))
- [x] Decide the OTel gateway's future: removed with its JSON event endpoint and alert sink; Alertmanager's default receiver has no integrations; push sources go to the OTel Collector over OTLP, mapped with OTTL ([ADR 0009](docs/architecture/decisions/0009-remove-the-otel-gateway.md))
- [x] Alert on `heartbeat_outsystems_export_blocked`: it is 1 from the first minute of a Loki outage, but only `OutSystemsLogExtractionBehind` fired, about 40 minutes in. `OutSystemsLogExportBlocked` (warning, one per target) fires after 2 minutes; PatientZero's `loki-outage` and `otel-outage` scenarios check it fires and resolves, `restarts` that a restart does not
- [x] Show rows committed past the `lag`: ADR 0008 accepts that the extractor skips them, but nothing said it happened; only the derived request rate dropped (PatientZero's `late-commits` scenario loses exactly the rows it held back). A recount once a minute counts each log type's rows per minute in the 10 minutes behind its watermark and compares them with what it delivered: `heartbeat_outsystems_late_rows_total` and `OutSystemsLateLogRows` for rows committed late, `heartbeat_outsystems_duplicate_rows_total` for rows sent twice; it only counts, so it sends nothing twice. `late-commits` checks the counter equals the rows held back ([ADR 0008](docs/architecture/decisions/0008-outsystems-11-log-extraction.md), amended)
- [x] `heartbeat_outsystems_log_delay_seconds` only reflects delays between the `lag` and the `lag` plus the poll interval, so it cannot show the log service falling behind, although ADR 0008 said it does: the ADR and the metric's docs now say it shows extraction freshness, and the late-row counter is the warning

### 3.4 Generic telemetry expansion
- [ ] Harden generic OTLP ingest after OutSystems path works
- [ ] Add MuleSoft parser later
- [ ] Add generic JSON/plaintext normalization later

### 3.5 Request traces

Design: [request traces](docs/architecture/application-observability.md#request-traces).

- [x] Step A: request timeline dashboard across log types by `Request_Key`, with the share of each log type's rows that carry it (*OutSystems Request Timeline*)
- [ ] Step B, after step A and the trace store [3.6]: synthesize OTLP spans from `Request_Key` in the extractor, with trace IDs derived from the key and logs ↔ traces links

### 3.6 OTLP trace ingest

Heartbeat accepts all three OpenTelemetry signals, so any source that sends
OTLP traces has somewhere to store them, and step B [3.5] reuses the store. No
real source sends traces yet, so the tests use generated ones (`telemetrygen`).
Not part of the phase 2 exit (decided 2026-10-21): OutSystems 11 self-managed
sends no traces, and the request timeline [3.5] already answers "what happened
in this request" from logs. Build this together with step B [3.5], as one
request-traces feature, once something consumes it: the first OTLP trace
source (OutSystems Cloud or ODC) or the phase 7 investigation timeline.

- [ ] Decide trace storage and retention (ADR; Grafana Tempo in single-binary mode is the natural fit next to Loki)
- [ ] Tempo as a pinned chart dependency with persistence and retention, off in the `minimal` profile; storage settings in the production example values
- [ ] Traces pipeline in the OTel Collector config (`otlp` → `memory_limiter`, `resource`, `batch` → Tempo); update the chart render test that pins the pipelines
- [ ] Grafana Tempo data source, with links from a log's trace ID to its trace and from a span to its logs
- [ ] Validate: kind-e2e sends traces and logs sharing a trace ID with `telemetrygen`, finds the trace in Tempo and follows the link from the log; record the full profile's added memory [16.2]

## 4. Core system: API / control plane (`apps/api`)

Delivery stage 3. PostgreSQL schema [1], Redis [0.2], runtime config [8]
and collector contracts are prerequisites, and its decisions are recorded
(ADRs 0013–0017). Deep links [4.9] need YAML templates and datasources [8.1,
9.3], which exist.

Remaining work, in order, one pull request each: PostgreSQL and Redis
connectivity, migrations and sqlc [4.1] → the API,
PostgreSQL and Valkey in the chart [4.1] → audit output [4.10], so every later
mutation is audited → login and sessions [4.2] → users and roles [4.2] →
inventory [4.3] → telemetry sources [4.4] → database targets and probe
definitions [4.5] → probe assignments, rendered to `managedCollectors` and
applied on kind [4.5, 2.5] → deep links [4.9] → this stage's validation.
The `managedCollectors` chart key they render to is in place [2.5]. ADR 0014's
pull request output waits for `heartbeat-deploy` [18]; until then the output
is `none`.

Investigations, alerting and reporting [4.6–4.8] and the job/result
contracts are built later, with their workers [6, 7, 12–14]: nothing consumes
them before, and their shape depends on the correlation model [6.2] and the
evidence design [12.4]. Do not mark those workflows complete from endpoint or
queue tests alone.

- [ ] Define/version API-to-worker job/result contracts before the first queue producer and consumer, with the first worker [6, 7]; integration-test each complete workflow when its worker lands (envelope and delivery rules: [ADR 0013](docs/architecture/decisions/0013-api-design-and-subsystem-boundaries.md))
- [x] Define how approved metadata probe assignments become YAML/Kubernetes runtime config [2.5, 8]; keep runtime desired state out of PostgreSQL ([ADR 0014](docs/architecture/decisions/0014-probe-assignments-to-runtime-config.md))
- [ ] Validate this stage: auth/ownership/secret refs, CRUD persistence, audit redaction and collector onboarding, with PatientZero registered through the API on kind and its database target's probes applied by the collector [16.1–16.2, 16.5]

### 4.1 Service bootstrap
- [x] Create Go service entrypoint `apps/api/cmd/api/`
- [x] Create idiomatic Go package layout under `apps/api/internal/`
- [x] Add config loading, logging, health endpoints, metrics, graceful shutdown
- [x] OpenAPI 3.1 spec with oapi-codegen server types; CI fails when the generated code is stale ([ADR 0013](docs/architecture/decisions/0013-api-design-and-subsystem-boundaries.md))
- [ ] sqlc queries; CI fails when the generated code is stale ([ADR 0013](docs/architecture/decisions/0013-api-design-and-subsystem-boundaries.md))
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL and Redis connectivity
- [ ] Apply `db/migrations` with golang-migrate from an init container before the API starts ([ADR 0013](docs/architecture/decisions/0013-api-design-and-subsystem-boundaries.md))
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL and Redis to the Helm chart once the API consumes them; keep monitored databases and test fixtures external (templates on `postgres` and `valkey/valkey`, off in production: [ADR 0015](docs/architecture/decisions/0015-postgresql-and-redis-delivery.md))

### 4.2 Identity and access
- [ ] Implement local auth for MVP: argon2id password hashes, cookie sessions in Redis ([ADR 0013](docs/architecture/decisions/0013-api-design-and-subsystem-boundaries.md))
- [ ] Implement users/roles/user_roles management
- [ ] Add minimal admin/wallboard access model
- [ ] Defer OIDC/SSO unless required early

### 4.3 Environment/application inventory
- [ ] Implement environments CRUD
- [ ] Implement applications CRUD
- [ ] Implement application components CRUD
- [ ] Enforce app -> environment ownership path

### 4.4 Telemetry source management
- [x] Decide what an OutSystems 11 source is: a mapping from an application to its `service.name` (`config.application_name`, `ingest_mode = agentless`); the extraction collector per installation stays in YAML ([ADR 0017](docs/architecture/decisions/0017-outsystems-sources-map-application-identity.md))
- [ ] Implement telemetry sources CRUD
- [ ] Support OutSystems telemetry source registration, with `config` checked against a JSON Schema per source type; within an environment, an `application_name` maps to one application
- [ ] Show whether the collector observes the source: an enabled `outsystems_logs` collector reports its environment in `GET /admin/config`
- [ ] Associate telemetry source to application
- [ ] Derive environment through application
- [ ] Validate ingest mode and required config
- [ ] Store secret refs only

### 4.5 Database target management
- [ ] Implement database targets CRUD
- [ ] Implement probe definition management/versioning
- [ ] Seed the built-in probe definitions from the collector's catalogs, with no `query_template` (an expand migration makes it nullable); a test fails when the seed and the catalogs differ. Custom definitions carry a versioned `query_template`, checked as one read-only `SELECT` with the collector's validator
- [ ] Implement probe assignment management, with approval states ([ADR 0014](docs/architecture/decisions/0014-probe-assignments-to-runtime-config.md))
- [ ] Validate target config and safe probe policies
- [ ] Store credential refs only

### 4.6 Investigations API

Built with the session analyzer [6, 12], not in stage 3.

- [ ] Implement create investigation endpoint
- [ ] Implement read investigation status/results endpoint
- [ ] Implement evidence links endpoint
- [ ] Persist durable investigation metadata in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Queue jobs through Redis

### 4.7 Alerting API

Built with alert rendering and baselines [13], not in stage 3. Rule and route
provisioning needs [9.1, 9.4, 13.1].

- [ ] Implement alert policies CRUD
- [ ] Implement notification routes CRUD
- [ ] Implement adaptive baseline metadata endpoints
- [ ] Implement rule rendering/provisioning interface to Prometheus/Alertmanager

### 4.8 Reporting API

Built with the reporting worker [7, 14], not in stage 3.

- [ ] Implement report templates CRUD
- [ ] Implement report schedules CRUD
- [ ] Implement report run status/read endpoints
- [ ] Support on-demand report triggering

### 4.9 Log search / Grafana deep links
- [ ] Implement deep-link generation from YAML templates
- [ ] Implement log-search helper endpoints if needed for UI flows
- [ ] Keep Grafana/Loki integration template-driven, not DB-driven

### 4.10 Audit output
- [x] Decide how audit records are written and delivered: in the change's transaction to an `audit_outbox`, drained as OTLP log records through the OTel Collector to Loki ([ADR 0016](docs/architecture/decisions/0016-audit-records-through-an-outbox.md))
- [ ] Write a record for every admin/operator change in its transaction; drain the outbox to the OTel Collector, at least once, and delete rows once accepted; `audit_record.schema.json` in `packages/telemetry-contracts`
- [ ] Include request ID, actor, entity type/id, before/after, config version when relevant
- [ ] Ensure secrets never enter audit records: a test changes each audited entity and fails on a password, hash, session ID or token
- [ ] Export the outbox's row count and oldest age; alert when delivery stalls

---

## 5. Core system: Web UI (`apps/web`)

Delivery stage 4. Bootstrap/auth/inventory/onboarding screens require API
bootstrap, auth and CRUD [4.1–4.5]. Investigation screens require [4.6, 6, 12];
alert screens require policy/rule/route integration [4.7, 9.4, 13]; reports need
[4.8, 7, 14]. Those three are built with their APIs and workers, not as shells
in stage 4; shells/mocks are not end-to-end completion.
Grafana/Loki drill-down needs reachable datasources and templates [4.9, 9.3,
15.1]. Minimal authorization [4.2] precedes operator access; later hardening
[15.2] does not replace it.

- [ ] Validate this stage: API-backed login, roles, inventory/onboarding and deep links; investigation, alert and report screens are validated end to end with their workers [16.3]

### 5.1 UI bootstrap
- [ ] Create React/TypeScript app
- [ ] Set up routing, API client, auth/session handling, shared UI components

### 5.2 Primary operator screens
- [ ] Environments/applications screen
- [ ] Application details/components screen
- [ ] Telemetry sources screen
- [ ] Database targets onboarding screen
- [ ] Investigations screen
- [ ] Alert policies screen
- [ ] Reports screen
- [ ] Integrations/admin informational screen

### 5.3 MVP UX rules
- [ ] Make session investigation app-first: filter by application + user/IP + time range
- [ ] Derive/show environment from application
- [ ] Provide drill-down links to Grafana/Loki
- [ ] Keep assets out of the first UI release unless topology scope is approved

---

## 6. Core system: Session analyzer (`services/session-analyzer`)

### 6.1 Service bootstrap
- [ ] Create Go service entrypoint `services/session-analyzer/cmd/session-analyzer/`
- [ ] Create internal analysis/evidence/baselines packages
- [ ] Add Redis queue consumption, logging, metrics, health endpoints

### 6.2 Investigation correlation model
- [ ] Define deterministic app-first correlation model
- [ ] Correlate by:
  - [ ] application
  - [ ] derived environment
  - [ ] user ID
  - [ ] IP
  - [ ] request/session IDs
  - [ ] service/component
  - [ ] host
  - [ ] time window
- [ ] Query Loki + Prometheus + DB evidence + metadata DB
- [ ] Produce durable result summaries + evidence links
- [ ] Cache short-lived expensive results in Redis

### 6.3 Adaptive baselines
- [ ] Implement baseline computation package
- [ ] Start w/ rolling median + MAD or EWMA bands
- [ ] Compute per metric/application/period class
- [ ] Persist baseline metadata/version in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Keep live evaluation in Prometheus-compatible rules, not in PostgreSQL

---

## 7. Core system: Reporting (`services/reporting`)

### 7.1 Service bootstrap
- [ ] Create Go service entrypoint `services/reporting/cmd/reporting/`
- [ ] Create internal templates/jobs packages
- [ ] Add Redis queue integration, PostgreSQL access, metrics, health endpoints

### 7.2 Report generation
- [ ] Implement scheduled report jobs
- [ ] Implement on-demand report jobs
- [ ] Gather metrics/logs/investigation summaries
- [ ] Render HTML/CSV/PDF outputs
- [ ] Persist report run metadata
- [ ] Store artifact URI only when persistence is needed

### 7.3 MVP report content
- [ ] application/service health summary
- [ ] top regressions
- [ ] recurring wait/lock hotspots
- [ ] alert noise summary
- [ ] SLA/SLO deltas if available

---

## 8. Core system: Integrations, YAML config, and K8s runtime model

### 8.1 Integration YAML schema
- [x] Define `config/integrations.yaml` schema
- [x] Cover:
  - [x] Grafana base URL
  - [x] Loki endpoint
  - [x] Alertmanager endpoint
  - [x] SMTP/webhook/email delivery config
  - [x] dashboard URL templates
  - [x] collector definitions
  - [x] credential refs

### 8.2 Go config manager
- [x] Create shared config manager package
- [x] Parse YAML into typed structs
- [x] Validate schema + business rules
- [x] Compute `config_version` hash
- [x] Support redacted rendering for diagnostics
- [x] Fail closed on invalid candidate config
- [x] Reject unknown SQL Server probe names and OutSystems log types at load and on reload, naming the valid ones (the runtime check stays)

### 8.3 Hot reload and reconciliation
- [x] Implement immutable active config snapshots (`atomic.Value` / copy-on-write)
- [x] Diff desired collectors by stable ID
- [x] Add collector lifecycle interface:
  - [x] `Start`
  - [x] `Update`
  - [x] `Drain`
  - [x] `Stop`
  - [x] `Status`
- [x] Handle:
  - [x] add collector
  - [x] remove collector
  - [x] safe live update
  - [x] restart when live update unsupported
- [x] Preserve old active config on failed reload

### 8.4 K8s delivery and reload triggers
- [x] Deliver config via ConfigMap + secret refs
- [x] Mount projected config volume
- [x] Watch parent directory + debounce for dev/local if fsnotify is used
- [x] Support explicit `SIGHUP`
- [x] Support authenticated `POST /admin/config/reload`
- [ ] Optionally integrate reloader sidecar/controller
- [x] Expose config version + reload status in `GET /admin/config` and in metrics (`heartbeat_collector_config_*`: last reload result and time, reloads by result, active version)
- [x] Alert when a reload is rejected or fails to apply (`HeartbeatCollectorConfigReloadFailed`), on by default; `prometheusRules.configReloadAlert.enabled: false` turns it off

---

## 9. Core system: Grafana / Prometheus / Loki / Alertmanager / OTel infra

### 9.1 Prometheus
- [x] Provision scrape config for services and collectors
- [x] Add OutSystems recording rules: operation and error rates, p95 latency, availability and latency SLIs, burn-rate and extraction-lag alerts
- [x] Add SQL Server recording rules
- [x] Add alert rule output path (`rules/generated/`, loaded by Prometheus; nothing renders into it yet)
- [x] Add an `alerting` block so Prometheus sends alerts to Alertmanager (plus an always-firing Watchdog routed to a dead-man's switch)
- [x] `HeartbeatServiceDown` could not fire for a missing db-collector: Prometheus finds it through DNS on its headless Service, so with no pod there is no `up` series (seen in PatientZero's `collector-outage` scenario). It now fires on `absent(up{job="db-collector"})` too, in a rule file the chart includes only when the bundled Prometheus scrapes that job, and covers Loki; `collector-outage` and `loki-outage` check it fires and resolves

### 9.2 Loki
- [x] Provision Loki for app logs
- [x] Enforce low-cardinality label strategy
- [x] Keep high-cardinality investigation fields in log body/payload
- [x] Keep user, session and request IDs and client IP as structured metadata: the Collector no longer deletes them; Loki indexes only service.name, service.namespace, deployment.environment.name and outsystems.log_type
- [x] Decide how user IDs, session IDs and client IPs are kept in Loki: raw, with access to Loki and Grafana restricted [9.6] ([ADR 0012](docs/architecture/decisions/0012-personal-data-in-telemetry.md))
- [x] Loki deletes logs after 30 days by default (`loki.loki.limits_config.retention_period`, compactor retention with its delete requests in the chunks' store); `make chart-check` checks it in every profile ([application observability](docs/architecture/application-observability.md))
- [ ] Compliance sign-off on raw identifiers, Loki retention (30 days by default) and Grafana access before the first production deploy [18] ([ADR 0012](docs/architecture/decisions/0012-personal-data-in-telemetry.md))

### 9.3 Grafana
- [x] Provision datasources as code
- [x] Provision dashboards as code
- [x] Add deep-link templates for UI -> Grafana/Loki flows

### 9.4 Alertmanager
- [x] Provision routing configuration
- [x] Support grouping/dedupe/silence/delivery
- [ ] Integrate rendered routes from Heartbeat metadata (needs the API; routing is static today)
- [ ] Alertmanager's StatefulSet keeps `podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady` (its chart has no setting for it), so after a bad config its pod is never replaced and the upgrade waits ([kubernetes#67250](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67250))

### 9.5 OpenTelemetry Collector
- [x] Provision collector config
- [x] Route metrics/logs correctly to Prometheus/Loki paths
- [x] Prefer collector processors/config before custom service code

### 9.6 Network access to the bundled backends
- [x] NetworkPolicies for the OTel Collector, Prometheus, Alertmanager and Loki: only the components that use each one reach it (`backendNetworkPolicies`; Grafana stays open to whatever serves its UI, behind its login)

---

## 10. Feature track: OutSystems application observability MVP

### 10.1 Source onboarding
- [ ] Add/edit/disable OutSystems telemetry source
- [ ] Validate required ingest config and labels
- [ ] Associate source to application

### 10.2 Normalization contract
- [ ] Define canonical application event envelope
- [x] Map OutSystems default logs faithfully first (OutSystems column names as log attributes [3.3])
- [ ] Validate consistent environment/application/session fields

### 10.3 Telemetry wiring
- [x] Route sample OutSystems telemetry into Loki (`make kind-e2e`: fixture error rows → Loki)
- [ ] Generate/derive application metrics in Prometheus
- [ ] Validate Grafana queries against both

### 10.4 Dashboards and drill-down
- [x] Build OutSystems overview dashboard
- [x] Build OutSystems errors dashboard
- [x] Build OutSystems latency dashboard
- [x] Enable drill-down overview -> latency/errors -> Loki ([dashboards](docs/architecture/application-observability.md#dashboards))
- [x] Check the active users and sessions panels and the top fingerprints at production cardinality: `make patientzero-scale-collect` and `make patientzero-scale-check` compare Loki with `expected.json`. All 48 hours of a 48 h backlog match; the largest panel, *Users affected* over 47 h, holds 1,977 series, a tenth of `max_query_series` ([results](tools/patientzero/README.md#in-loki))

---

## 11. Feature track: SQL Server observability MVP

### 11.1 Target onboarding
- [ ] Add/edit/disable SQL Server target
- [ ] Validate reachability safely
- [ ] Attach approved probe assignments

### 11.2 Signal coverage
- [ ] waits
- [ ] blocking/locks
- [ ] sessions/connections
- [ ] memory pressure
- [ ] storage pressure
- [ ] throughput/latency
- [ ] error events where available
- [ ] page life expectancy per NUMA node (`Buffer Node` counters); the `buffer_cache` probe reports only the server-wide `Buffer Manager` value
- [ ] `blocking_session_id` as a label creates and drops a series for every blocking session: export the blocked count, and the top blockers as evidence [12.4]

### 11.3 Dashboards
- [ ] SQL Server overview dashboard
- [ ] waits/locks dashboard
- [ ] sessions dashboard
- [ ] drill-down flows for DB troubleshooting

---

## 12. Feature track: Session investigation

### 12.1 Investigation model
- [ ] No PostgreSQL session table
- [ ] Compute session/user correlation from Loki/Prometheus at investigation time

### 12.2 API + jobs
- [ ] Create investigation
- [ ] queue analysis job
- [ ] assemble evidence
- [ ] return timeline/anomaly summary/evidence links

### 12.3 UI
- [ ] app-first investigation filter
- [ ] event timeline
- [ ] anomaly windows
- [ ] links to Grafana/Loki

### 12.4 Collector evidence

Moved from the collector stage: the destination depends on the investigation
design, and nothing consumes evidence before the session analyzer [6].

- [ ] Define the evidence content (today only a row count), destination, schema, target/probe identity, timestamps, retention, redaction and bounded delivery/failure behavior; keep raw evidence out of PostgreSQL
- [ ] Publish retrievable investigation evidence snapshots (the default `LoggingEvidenceSink` currently discards them)
- [ ] Test a blocking/session snapshot through publication and subsequent investigation retrieval, separately from Prometheus metric tests; sink wiring alone is not publication

---

## 13. Feature track: Alerting and adaptive telemetry

### 13.1 Static alerts
- [ ] Persist alert policy intent in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Render executable rules to Prometheus
- [ ] Render route intent to Alertmanager
- [ ] Validate trigger/route/dedupe/resolve path

### 13.2 Adaptive baselines
- [ ] Compute explainable baselines
- [ ] Persist baseline parameters/version
- [ ] Render thresholds to Prometheus-compatible rules
- [ ] Ensure hard guardrails remain in place

### 13.3 Adaptive telemetry controls
- [ ] Design telemetry escalation profiles
- [ ] Add anomaly/incident-based escalation logic later
- [ ] Ensure extra collection never amplifies DB load unsafely

---

## 14. Feature track: Reporting

### 14.1 Templates and schedules
- [ ] Implement report templates
- [ ] Implement report schedules
- [ ] Implement application-owned report runs

### 14.2 Delivery
- [ ] email delivery
- [ ] downloadable HTML/PDF/CSV
- [ ] object storage retention when needed

---

## 15. Feature track: Integrations and hardening

Collector reliability and endpoint security are in sections 2.6–2.7; replica
ownership and outage testing are in section 19.

### 15.1 Grafana/Loki productization
- [ ] validate integration config from YAML
- [ ] validate datasources
- [ ] support deep links
- [ ] support permission-aware sharing if needed

### 15.2 Security and reliability
- [ ] add authn/authz hardening
- [ ] add query budgets
- [ ] add rate limits
- [ ] add retry/idempotency rules
- [ ] add worker backoff behavior

### 15.3 Audit and runbooks
- [ ] ship audit records to a SIEM, as an OTel Collector exporter, when one is chosen; they reach Loki from stage 3 [4.10]
- [x] write SQL Server onboarding runbook ([guide](docs/guides/database-targets.md))
- [ ] write alert tuning runbook
- [ ] write ops/runbook docs for reload failures, collector crashes, queue backlogs

---

## 16. Test and validation

### 16.1 Unit tests
- [ ] SQL normalization logic
- [ ] metric labeling/schema validation
- [ ] baseline calculations
- [ ] session correlation rules
- [ ] report rendering
- [ ] YAML config validation
- [ ] config hash stability
- [ ] reconciliation diff logic

### 16.2 Integration tests
- [x] collector -> Prometheus (`make kind-e2e`, against a Docker SQL Server)
- [ ] OTLP ingest -> normalized logs/metrics
- [ ] API -> PostgreSQL
- [x] alert rules -> Alertmanager routing (`make kind-e2e`: Watchdog reaches Alertmanager)
- [ ] investigation query -> evidence assembly
- [x] failed reload keeps previous active config (`make kind-e2e`)

### 16.3 End-to-end tests
- [ ] onboard OutSystems telemetry source
- [ ] see logs in Loki
- [ ] see metrics in Prometheus/Grafana
- [ ] create investigation from UI
- [ ] view alert flow end-to-end
- [ ] generate report end-to-end

### 16.4 K8s/runtime tests
- [x] ConfigMap reload semantics (`make kind-e2e`: valid update hot-reloads in place; invalid update rejected while collection continues)
- [ ] fsnotify parent-directory watcher behavior if enabled
- [ ] `SIGHUP` reload path
- [ ] `/admin/config/reload` path
- [ ] collector add/remove/update reconciliation under live traffic

### 16.5 PatientZero test application

A synthetic OutSystems 11 application on the sandbox SQL Server: each request
runs real SQL against its business database and writes the log rows the
platform would into its own logging database
([ADR 0010](docs/architecture/decisions/0010-patientzero-test-application.md)).
Code in `tools/patientzero/`, its own Go module and Helm chart, never part of
the product chart or releases. A real logging database is only read, by
the survey: nothing is written to it, and only its DDL and aggregates reach
git.

First slice, with phase 2:
- [x] Run the survey with a read-only login on a real logging database's replica [3.3]; the replica, a stale extract, was deleted afterwards
- [x] Logging schema from the surveyed DDL (ten cycle tables per log type, current and `_Previous` views), shared with the collector's fixtures so a schema change is made once
- [x] Traffic profile from the survey's aggregates only (`load/traffic.js`): integration calls per screen request, peak factor, the day's hourly curve (a `day` load profile); duration distributions, error ratio and identifier coverage were not in the extract
- [x] Service bootstrap: `tools/patientzero/` module, own SQL login with write rights on `patientzero` and `patientzero_log` only, health endpoint, Dockerfile, Helm chart into a `patientzero` namespace, `make patientzero-up` and `make patientzero-down`
- [x] First entry points: a Traditional screen, a Reactive server action and an exposed REST API; each request runs business SQL and writes its log rows under one `Request_Key`, with the caller's session, user and client IP
- [x] k6 load: virtual users with stable identities; smoke, steady, peak, soak and day profiles, run as a Job on kind (`make patientzero-load`); the mix in `load/traffic.js` takes the survey's aggregates
- [x] Scenario runner: scenario files (fault, duration, expected PromQL/LogQL/alert signals), an admin endpoint to start them, and a run journal (JSONL: users, sessions, requests, and each fault with its start and end); in-process `latency` and `errors` faults, `make patientzero-scenario` ([scenarios](tools/patientzero/scenarios/README.md)). Cluster faults (restarts, outages) need the host-side runner the format leaves room for
- [x] Ingest scenarios: `rotation` (weekly rotation on demand), `log-backlog`, `log-growth`, backfill within Loki's 168h limit, commits held back past the `lag`, and restarts and outages of the db-collector, the OTel Collector, Loki and SQL Server; the collector's clock is never changed; the restarts and outages are cluster faults, applied on the host with the kubeconfig and Docker ([cluster faults](tools/patientzero/scenarios/README.md#cluster-faults)). Done: `rotation`, `log-backlog` (commits late within the `lag`), `late-commits` (held back past it: those rows are lost, as ADR 0008 accepts), `log-growth`, `restarts`, and the `loki-outage`, `otel-outage`, `collector-outage` and `sqlserver-outage`, each checked against the rows PatientZero committed ([delivery checks](tools/patientzero/scenarios/README.md#delivery-checks)); the restarts and outages are applied by `make patientzero-scenario` as the run's host agent. The backfill within Loki's 168h limit is not a scenario (2026-10-25): `make patientzero-scale-collect` and `-check` backfill a 48 h generated log through the same extractor, Collector and Loki, and every hour matches its known answer [10.4]
- [x] SLO scenarios: `bad-deploy` and `slow-sql` fire the existing burn-rate alerts in Alertmanager, end to end, with the rules' real windows (`make patientzero-scenario NAME=bad-deploy`, `NAME=slow-sql`); new `deploy` and `sql-latency` faults, and PatientZero logs slow SQL as the platform does ([SLO scenarios](tools/patientzero/scenarios/README.md#slo-scenarios))
- [x] A CI workflow runs every scenario against PatientZero on a fresh kind cluster and checks their signals (`.github/workflows/scenarios.yml`, `make patientzero-scenarios`, in a fixed order): nightly on `master`, by hand, and on the release pull request, where `ci-ok` fails while a scenario fails, so no release is tagged with one. Not in `make kind-e2e`: the thirteen scenarios take about two and a half hours and would gate every pull request on them
- [ ] The first green nightly run of the scenarios workflow is this stage's validation evidence [3]; the workflow is on `master` since 2026-10-27, so the first nightly run is on 2026-10-28
- [ ] Replace the hand-run load in the [live demo](docs/guides/live-demo.md) with the scenarios [16.2, 16.3]

Later, each with the phase that needs it:
- [ ] Phase 3: register PatientZero through the API as the reference application: its environment, application, OutSystems source and business database target, with probes applied by the collector [4]
- [ ] Phase 4: onboard PatientZero from the UI [5, 16.3]
- [ ] Phase 7, with the analyzer and alert work that uses them: timers, extension calls and a fake consumed REST partner; long-running screens and timers; `Instant` in a configured time zone across daylight saving switches; the `blocking` (and deadlock), `slow-partner`, `timer-backlog` and `bad-front-end` scenarios [6, 13]
- [ ] Phase 7: investigations and reports on PatientZero runs compared with their journals; decide soak runs or a Prometheus TSDB backfill for multi-day baselines and weekly reports [6, 13, 14]
- [ ] OTLP mode for the OutSystems Cloud/ODC streams and traces [3.4, 3.6]; a MuleSoft-like source [3.4]; an Oracle-backed variant [21]

Hardening, from the 2026-10-22 security and performance reviews. PatientZero
trusts its caller by design, so these keep it on the load path:
- [x] Default-deny NetworkPolicy in the `patientzero` namespace that admits port 8080 only from its known callers. PatientZero takes the user, session and client IP from request headers, so anything that reaches it can write forged rows into Loki. Every pod in the namespace denies ingress, and port 8080 admits only the k6 load Job's pods (`make patientzero-load` and the scenarios' load); the scenario runner's admin calls come through `kubectl port-forward` and the kubelet probes from the node, which NetworkPolicy does not filter. The Service stays ClusterIP; `make chart-check` checks the policy against the load Job's labels ([who can reach it](tools/patientzero/README.md#who-can-reach-it))
- [x] The HTML screen sends `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, a restrictive CSP and `X-Frame-Options`, on its errors and `503`s too: `default-src 'none'` (the page loads nothing), no framing (`frame-ancestors 'none'`, `DENY`), no base URL or form target. `placeOrder` already returns a generic error and leaves the detail to the error log row, as `orderList` and `apiOrders` do
- [x] Backpressure on the business-database path: both SQL Server pools are sized (`PATIENTZERO_SQL_MAX_OPEN_CONNS`, 20) and the entry points share a concurrency limit (`PATIENTZERO_MAX_IN_FLIGHT`, 64) that answers 503 with `Retry-After` past it, counted as `shed` in the journal; waits for a pool connection are bounded by that limit, not by a timeout. `/readyz` stays up while the pool is full ([PatientZero](tools/patientzero/README.md))

## 18. Production delivery: EKS and Argo CD

The shared chart already runs on kind and in CI [0.4]. This stage takes it to
production with the defaults in
[ADR 0005](docs/architecture/decisions/0005-production-delivery-and-operations-defaults.md).
It follows the Web UI so the first production deploy carries a usable product;
pull it forward if a production SQL Server must be monitored sooner.

- [ ] First: review the observability platform, the organization's ELK stack (Elastic Cloud) against the bundled Grafana stack, on the same data (the Collector sends to both); compare search, investigation queries, alerting, cost and operations; record the choice in an ADR ([ADR 0011](docs/architecture/decisions/0011-platform-agnostic-telemetry-boundary.md)). If ELK wins: its content pack (Kibana dashboards, rules, index templates and ILM) and log/metric query adapters
- [ ] `heartbeat-deploy` config repository with Argo CD Applications and per-environment values; CI that renders each environment and loads it with the Go loader; branch protection
- [ ] GitHub App for the API on `heartbeat-deploy` only (contents and pull requests: read and write), private key in Secrets Manager through External Secrets, so approved assignments open pull requests ([ADR 0014](docs/architecture/decisions/0014-probe-assignments-to-runtime-config.md))
- [ ] RDS for PostgreSQL and ElastiCache for Valkey in the infrastructure code; production values point the API at them ([ADR 0015](docs/architecture/decisions/0015-postgresql-and-redis-delivery.md))
- [ ] The release workflow [0.5] also publishes the images and the chart to ECR through GitHub OIDC
- [ ] EKS infrastructure as code; AWS Secrets Manager with External Secrets
- [ ] Route the Watchdog to healthchecks.io and test loss of the monitoring path
- [ ] Notification receivers: Discord, then Slack, Teams and WhatsApp; set up the WhatsApp Business Account and alert template
- [ ] Document where the monitored SQL Servers sit relative to the EKS VPC; validate pod-to-database DNS/TCP/authentication/TLS from EKS
- [ ] Validate production-specific networking, identity, TLS, storage, retention and restore in the target environment; kind tests alone do not establish production acceptance
- [ ] Optional: rehearse Argo CD on kind before the first production deploy
- [ ] TLS and auth headers on the collector's OTLP exporter, before it sends to an external Collector or platform
- [ ] TLS for the collector's admin endpoints: the bearer token travels over plain HTTP

## 19. Advanced collector reliability and HA

Builds on the single-collector baseline [2.6]. Keep the collector a singleton
until ownership is validated. Design details:
[Collector recovery and high availability](docs/architecture/database-observability.md#collector-recovery-and-high-availability-planned).

- [ ] Define per-target ownership/takeover across replicas with fencing or equivalent duplicate-polling protection
- [ ] Define recovery-time/data-gap objectives and downstream buffering/replay limits separately from collector failover
- [ ] Test target/process/node loss, network partitions, reloads during failure, and storage/downstream outages; measure recovery, gaps, duplicates and database load, and re-check the baseline [2.6] under these failures
- [ ] Validate security, operational runbooks, audit shipping and restore procedures [15]

## 20. Fallback file ingestion

- [ ] Implement ingestion of uploaded/exported files only after live collection and reliability are validated, for cases where direct database connectivity is unavailable
- [ ] Keep it a last-resort, fallback-only ingest mode, never the default onboarding path; expose it as a telemetry source ingest mode [4.4]
- [ ] Define accepted formats, validation, lineage, source identity and freshness warnings
- [ ] Test malformed/stale inputs, accepted formats and investigation use end to end

## 21. Oracle collector and integration

The coverage check below gates the rest of this section: building a custom
Oracle collector before knowing what Alloy covers risks discarding it after the
comparison [22].

- [ ] Before any Oracle code, time-boxed to about half a day: check what Grafana Alloy (and established Oracle exporters) cover for the planned Oracle signals, permissions, TLS and evidence needs. Record the outcome as an ADR: build the custom Oracle collector, adopt Alloy for Oracle, or run the comparison [22] before this section
- [ ] Define supported Oracle versions, signal coverage, connector/licensing constraints, least-privilege permissions and query budgets
- [ ] Implement secure connectivity, credential refs/TLS, pooling, bounded queries and Oracle probes with explicit metric units/types/labels and structured evidence
- [ ] Extend config/schema, API target/probe management and Web onboarding for Oracle
- [ ] Add Oracle recording/alert rules, Grafana dashboards and investigation/report integration
- [ ] Add an isolated non-production Oracle fixture, Helm delivery support and onboarding/operations runbook
- [ ] Test supported-version queries, permissions, telemetry semantics and database load
- [ ] Validate onboarding → collection → dashboards → alerts/investigations/reports and repeat failure/reload/freshness/ownership tests; retain evidence before section 22

## 22. Final custom collector versus Grafana Alloy comparison

The last planned delivery stage, after all preceding required workflows and
validation gates, including Oracle integration (unless the coverage check [21]
moved it earlier). Conditional section-17 scope is not a prerequisite unless
explicitly promoted into the delivery plan. Evaluation design:
[Custom collector and Alloy comparison](docs/architecture/database-observability.md#custom-collector-and-alloy-comparison-late-roadmap).

- [ ] Create a dedicated comparison branch only after preceding stages pass validation
- [ ] Verify Alloy's SQL Server and Oracle capabilities at evaluation time; document unsupported coverage rather than assuming parity
- [ ] Run equivalent non-production workloads with isolated metric identities and controlled combined query load
- [ ] Compare coverage, custom evidence, metric semantics, permissions/TLS, query load/resources, reloads, failure/recovery, gaps/duplicates, buffering/replay and operational cost, for each engine separately
- [ ] Record reproducible configurations, results and an evidence-backed decision: retain custom collection, adopt Alloy for suitable workloads, or support both with explicit per-target ownership and a shared telemetry contract
- [ ] Review the decision before merging the selected implementation; treat production adoption separately from the experiment
