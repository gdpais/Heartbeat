//
// where <REF> is the reference upper-cased, with "/", "-" and "." replaced
// by underscores ([Key]). The value must be a colon-separated
// "username:password" pair; the password is everything after the first
// colon. [Files] reads it from a file of that name in a directory, such as a
// mounted Kubernetes Secret, on every call, so a rotated credential needs no
// restart; [Env] reads it from the environment variable of that name.
